This report contains an introduction to quantum stars and a quantitative study of various
properties of white dwarf. A structure equation for white dwarfs is deduced and numerically
solved for both relativistic and nonrelativistic cases. Then, a combination of both limits is used to
find another structure equation that is also numerically solved. Finally, using a different approach
the Chandrasekhar limit is derived and solved.
